## Request Body

| Parameter | Description | Mandatory/Optional | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| apikey | Your OpenAlgo API key | Mandatory | - |
| strategy_id | Strategy id, a positive integer | Mandatory | - |
| run_id | Narrow the result to one run, a positive integer | Optional | null (every run) |

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| status | string | "success" or "error" |
| data | array | Order objects, oldest first by placement time |

Each object in `data`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | integer | The strategy order row's id |
| run_id | integer | Run the order belongs to |
| leg_id | integer | Leg within the strategy |
| kind | string | Why the order was placed (see order kinds below) |
| position_ref | string or null | The exact position the order belongs to. A signal flip can keep an outgoing position under `superseded` while the new side is live; fills and exits settle the reference they name |
| broker_order_id | string or null | The broker's order id on a live run, the sandbox engine's id on a sandbox run, `null` before the broker answered |
| symbol | string | OpenAlgo symbol |
| exchange | string | Exchange code |
| action | string | `BUY` or `SELL` |
| qty | integer | Quantity sent |
| product | string or null | The product actually sent, translated to the venue: a CNC strategy sends NRML for an option leg |
| pricetype | string | `MARKET` |
| price | number | Order price, `0` for a market order |
| trigger_price | number | Trigger price, `0` when unused |
| status | string | `pending`, `open`, `complete`, `cancelled` or `rejected`; in the desktop also `unconfirmed` |
| placed_at | string | ISO 8601 UTC, written before the broker answered |
| filled_at | string or null | ISO 8601 UTC, set when the status first becomes `complete` |
| avg_fill_price | number or null | Average fill price reported by the broker |
| filled_qty | integer or null | Quantity actually filled |
| reject_reason | string or null | Broker or engine rejection text |

### Order kinds

`entry`, `exit_sl`, `exit_target`, `exit_trail`, `exit_overall_sl`,
`exit_overall_target`, `exit_lock_profit`, `exit_eod`, `exit_expiry`,
`exit_daily_loss_limit`, `exit_close_all`, `exit_leg_manual`, `exit_recovery`,
`exit_signal`

## Notes

- Rows are ordered by placement time, **oldest first**, so an entry always
  comes before its exit. This is the opposite order to [`/runs`](./runs.md) and
  [`/events`](./events.md).
- **A `run_id` belonging to another strategy matches nothing.** The query only
  looks at this strategy's runs.
- The row is written **before** the broker is called, so an order can appear
  here with `status: "pending"` and a `null` `broker_order_id`. That is
  deliberate: an order that reached the broker but was never recorded would be
  invisible after a restart.
- In the desktop, `status: "unconfirmed"` means the order was sent and the
  broker gave no definite answer. It may be at the broker, so it is never sent
  again. OpenAlgo looks for it in the broker's order book and settles the row
  (see the `order_unconfirmed` events on [`/events`](./events.md)); the
  position stays managed meanwhile.
- A positive `filled_qty` proves exposure in every status, including `open`,
  `cancelled` and `rejected`: a working order can partly fill before it ends.
  A missing `avg_fill_price` means the exposure is real but its value is not
  known, not that it is zero.
- These rows are the engine's record of what it **asked for**. For money, the
  broker is the authority. The strategy's page in the app reads the broker's
  own order book and uses these rows only to decide which of its rows belong to
  this strategy.
- There is no `limit` on this endpoint. Narrow with `run_id` when a strategy has
  a long history.
- Sandbox orders go to the sandbox engine and never reach a broker. Their
  `broker_order_id` is the sandbox engine's own reference.
- In the desktop, a failed read answers 500 `An unexpected error occurred`
  rather than an empty list.

## Use Cases

- **Audit**: reconstruct exactly what a run sent and when
- **Fill analysis**: compare `avg_fill_price` against the intended entry
- **Failure triage**: look for `status: "rejected"` and read `reject_reason`
