## Request Body

| Parameter | Description | Mandatory/Optional | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| apikey | Your OpenAlgo API key | Mandatory | - |

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| status | string | `success` or `error` |
| data | object | The funds |
| mode | string | `analyze` in analyzer mode; absent in live mode |

### Data Object Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| availablecash | string (live), number (analyzer) | Cash free for new orders |
| collateral | string (live), number (analyzer) | Margin from pledged holdings |
| m2mrealized | string (live), number (analyzer) | Realized profit or loss today |
| m2munrealized | string (live), number (analyzer) | Profit or loss on open positions |
| utiliseddebits | string (live), number (analyzer) | Margin in use |

## Analyzer Mode

The sandbox answers with its own account: 1 crore starting capital (set on the Sandbox page), every value a JSON number, plus the analyzer-only fields above. Margin is blocked when an order is placed and released when it is cancelled or its position is closed. See [Sandbox mode](../../user/sandbox.md).

## Errors

Validation errors on this endpoint carry `message` as an object:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": {"apikey": ["Missing data for required field."]}
}
```

| HTTP | `message` | When |
|------|-----------|------|
| 500 | The broker's reason, or `Could not reach the broker. Check your internet connection and try again.` | The broker did not return your funds |

Errors common to every endpoint (missing or invalid API key, OpenAlgo locked, wrong method, rate limit) are listed in the [API overview](../README.md#errors-common-to-every-endpoint).

## Notes

- In live mode every value is a string with two decimals, as on the web.
- Total margin is `availablecash` plus `collateral`.
- Rate limit: 100 requests per second per caller. See [Rate limiting](../rate-limiting.md).

## In the desktop

- In the desktop, the sandbox keeps the margin that resting orders hold and the full margin of a fill that reverses a position. The web's sandbox drops both after a fill, so for the same activity the desktop can show more `utiliseddebits` and less `availablecash` than the web: it matches the sandbox's own books.
- In the desktop, the sandbox checks margin again when an order fills. An exit that fills after its position was already closed opens a new position and blocks that position's margin then, or is rejected for insufficient funds. The web opened such a position with no margin.
- In the desktop, sandbox margin on CRYPTO includes the contract value (10 BTCUSD.P contracts of 0.001 BTC at 60,000 at 10x hold 60, not 60,000).
