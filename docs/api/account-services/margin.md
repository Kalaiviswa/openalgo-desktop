## Analyzer Mode

This endpoint always asks your live broker, in analyzer mode too, as on the web. Nothing is placed. It needs a broker session either way.

## Errors

Validation errors on this endpoint carry `message` as a string that spells out a Python dictionary:

```json
{
  "message": "{'positions': ['Positions must contain 1 to 50 items.']}",
  "status": "error"
}
```

| HTTP | `message` | When |
|------|-----------|------|
| 400 | `{'positions': ['Positions must contain 1 to 50 items.']}` | An empty list, or more than 50 |
| 400 | `{'positions': {0: {'quantity': ['Not a valid string.']}}}` | A number where a string is expected |
| 400 | `Position 1: Invalid quantity format` | A quantity that is not a whole number |
| 400 | `Position 1: Quantity must be a positive number` | Zero or a negative quantity |
| 400 | `Position 1: Price cannot be negative` | A negative price |
| 400 | `Position 1: Symbol NOTASYMBOL not found on NSE. Check the symbol and exchange, or download the master contract again.` | A position's symbol is not in the master contract |
| 400 | The broker's reason | The broker refused the calculation |
| 501 | `Margin calculation not implemented for broker: <broker>` | Your broker offers no margin calculation |
| 500 | `Failed to calculate margin due to internal error` | The broker did not answer |

Errors common to every endpoint (missing or invalid API key, OpenAlgo locked, wrong method, rate limit) are listed in the [API overview](../README.md#errors-common-to-every-endpoint).

## Notes

- Positions are numbered from 0 in validation messages (`{0: ...}`) and from 1 in the others (`Position 1: ...`), as on the web.
- Hedged baskets (spreads, iron condors) get the hedge benefit only from brokers whose margin calculator recognises it.
- Figures can move with prices between the check and the order.
- Rate limit: 100 requests per second per caller. See [Rate limiting](../rate-limiting.md).

## In the desktop

- In the desktop, a basket with a position whose symbol is not in the master contract is refused as a whole, naming the position. The web's broker adapters drop that position and total the rest, so a web "success" can leave a leg out.
- In the desktop, the answer always has the three fields above. On the web, IIFL Capital also returns `margin_benefit` (always 0.0); the web docs list `margin_benefit`, but its other brokers do not return it.
