# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenAlgo Desktop are recorded here. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 1.0.1

The first update after 1.0.0. It fixes the limitations listed in 1.0.0,
makes busy pages stop slowing the app's handling of market ticks, and shows
more of the app's own health. If you run 1.0.0, OpenAlgo offers this update
in the app; choose Update when no live strategy is running.

### Order safety

- Delta Exchange: a smart order with a fractional target position is decided
  in exact quantities (holding 2 with a target of 0.5 sells exactly 1.5),
  never rounded down. Everywhere else, and in sandbox mode, a fractional
  target is refused instead of rounded.
- A GTT order with a fractional quantity is refused, when placing and when
  modifying, live and in sandbox mode.
- An options split order holds back its remaining chunks after one whose
  outcome is unknown, as a split order already did; check the order book
  before sending them again.
- Options orders, options multi-order legs and GTT orders refuse a quantity
  above 2,147,483,647, as placing an order already did.

### Security

- Your OpenAlgo API key is no longer saved in the app window's browser
  storage on disk. It is kept in memory while you are signed in, and a copy
  left there by 1.0.0 is erased the first time 1.0.1 starts.
- After you generate a new API key, the books and order forms use it at once;
  before, they kept sending the old key until the window was reloaded.

### Speed under load

- The log, traffic, health, security, diagnostics, MCP audit and analyzer
  pages read, shape and send their answers off the threads that carry the
  market data feed. With a large log open in several browsers, strategy
  decisions were lost before; now none are, with decisions in about 5 ms.
- Strategy order books and history, OpenScript deployment books, the Action
  Center, the analyzer status and the Telegram and WhatsApp statistics do the
  same, and pages that refresh the same data share one read.
- The first API call after a start, a sign-in or a new key checks the key
  off the threads that carry the market data feed, so a burst of API calls
  no longer delays the handling of market ticks.

### Health

- The Health page shows each database's size and growth, what each reader of
  a broker feed had to skip, records that could not be saved, strategy price
  counts and order tracking, and turns amber or red with a plain sentence
  when anything was skipped or lost.
- Alerts that nothing clears on its own have a Resolve button. An open alert
  shows what is wrong now, not what was wrong when it opened.
- Health and Run diagnostics count market data dropped for apps on the 8765
  feed, and the size of every database including sandbox and Historify.
- The analyzer status and the WhatsApp statistics answer "could not be read"
  when their log cannot be read, instead of showing zero.

### Accessibility and wording

- Every signed-in page passes an accessibility scan with no exceptions, in
  light and dark: clearer contrast for margin values, statuses, password
  rules, toast messages and the Tools tiles, and labels for screen readers.
- The strategies panel says what is true in the desktop: a live run is a
  hidden app window, and quitting or signing out pauses every run and leaves
  its positions. The scalping badge reads One-Click on or off.

## 1.0.0

The first release of OpenAlgo Desktop: a single-user desktop version of
OpenAlgo web for Windows, macOS and Linux, with no server to set up, no Python
runtime and no `.env` file. Everything is set inside the app.

Installers: Windows x64 (NSIS, per user), macOS Apple Silicon (M1 to M4) and
Intel (`.dmg`), Linux x64 and ARM64 (AppImage and `.deb`). Raspberry Pi is not
a supported device for the desktop app; use OpenAlgo web on a Pi.

### Compatibility with OpenAlgo web

- `/api/v1` on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` answers like the web, field for field:
  every endpoint the web documents, pinned by contract tests against responses
  recorded from a live web instance. The Python SDK, TradingView, Amibroker,
  Chartink, GoCharting, Excel and MCP clients work unchanged.
- The market data WebSocket on `ws://127.0.0.1:8765` speaks the web protocol:
  LTP, Quote and Depth modes, depth 5, 20, 30 and 50, and the order update
  stream.
- Broker redirect URLs follow the web convention,
  `http://127.0.0.1:5000/<broker>/callback`.
- The OpenAlgo web screens carried over nearly verbatim, including the
  `/trading` terminal on openalgo-charts 2.6.7 with custom intervals and daily
  study history, and Strike Profile (GEX and DEX by strike and expiry, exactly
  as on the web).

### Brokers

- All 37 OpenAlgo web brokers: Zerodha, Fyers, Upstox, Dhan and Dhan
  (Sandbox), Kotak Securities, Groww, Angel One; the Symphony XTS family
  (5 Paisa (XTS), JainamXts, CompositEdge, RMoney, Ibulls, IIFL, Wisdom
  Capital); the Noren family (Shoonya, Flattrade, TradeSmart, Zebu) and
  Firstock; Arrow, Paytm Money, Pocketful, HDFC Sky, HDFC Securities, Rupeezy;
  5 Paisa, Tradejini, Nubra, IndMoney, IIFL Capital; Alice Blue, Definedge,
  mStock, Motilal Oswal, Samco; and Delta Exchange for crypto.
- Books, trades, positions and holdings return OpenAlgo symbols for every
  broker. A broker reply that cannot be read is an error, never an empty book
  or a flat position, so close-all never reports "all squared off" while a
  segment is unread.
- Broker keys are entered in the app; several brokers can be saved and one is
  connected at a time. Sessions resume after sign-in until the daily 03:00 IST
  cut-off.
- Orders are paced at each broker's published rate; Samco, Tradejini, HDFC Sky,
  HDFC Securities, Pocketful and 5 Paisa, which publish none, at 10 a second.

### Order safety

- A placement has three outcomes: accepted, refused, or unknown. An order whose
  outcome is unknown is never sent again; it is settled from the broker's order
  book, and new entries wait until the gap in order facts is repaired.
- Strategies, OpenScript runs, scalping stops and Action Center orders are tied
  to the broker account they were opened on. An exit is never sent through
  another account, and a run reports what it holds elsewhere.
- A strategy page that loses the app's answer keeps the order pending and asks
  again with the same identity, so a lost answer never becomes a second order.
- Semi-Auto orders approved in the Action Center are followed by their run; an
  unreadable Semi-Auto setting refuses the order instead of sending it.
- Strategy ticks never wait on the database, and a deciding price is never
  lost under load. Stop-loss saves wait for a busy database instead of failing.

### Trading

- Sandbox mode (analyzer mode) mirroring the web's sandbox: 1 crore starting
  capital, margin blocking, fills from live ticks, weighted-average netting,
  T+1 settlement, MIS auto square-off, GTT and catch-up after the app was
  closed, kept in its own database.
- Strategy module and risk management with a pure risk core that passes the
  web's risk vectors; strategy webhooks for TradingView and GoCharting.
- Chartink strategies and webhooks; Action Center for Semi-Auto orders.
- The `/trading` charting terminal with custom indicators, OpenScript files and
  live OpenScript runs on the same engine as backtests.
- Scalping terminal with its risk monitor.
- Options tools: option chain, Greeks, OI tracker and range, max pain, IV
  chart, IV smile, volatility surface, GEX, gamma density, Strike Profile,
  straddle charts, strategy builder and arbitrage.
- Historify on DuckDB with download jobs, scheduler and exports.
- Playground, API key management, P&L tracker, leverage settings.

### Alerts and AI clients

- Native Telegram bot with commands, alerts and analytics.
- Native WhatsApp bot with QR and pair-code pairing and alerts.
- Native MCP server with the web's 49 tools, over stdio for Claude Desktop and
  Claude Code and over HTTP at `/mcp`; scoped tokens created on the API Key
  page, per-token limits and an audit log.

### Monitoring and settings

- Live, sandbox, security, traffic and latency logs; Health Monitor; Run
  diagnostics, including how fresh each broker feed is.
- Admin pages for freeze quantities, holidays, market timings, diagnostics
  and Remote MCP.
- Server Settings for ports, bind address and access from other devices. A
  port already in use is reported in the app with the fix, including the
  AirPlay Receiver case on macOS.

### Security

- No OS keychain on any platform. The data key is derived from your OpenAlgo
  password and unlocked when you sign in; after a restart the API, webhooks
  and MCP stay locked until you sign in.
- Broker credentials and tokens encrypted with AES-256-GCM, each bound to its
  row and column.
- Passwords and API keys hashed with Argon2id; API keys found through an HMAC
  index with a short cache.
- Signed-in user required on every non-public route; browser origins compared
  exactly; strict Content Security Policy; devtools off in release builds.
- Broker sign-in verified by single-use `state`, with account binding for
  brokers whose redirect does not return it.
- Sign-in and API key failures throttled per address; `/api/v1` limited as on
  the web.
- Logs keep API keys, tokens, OAuth codes, passwords and TOTP secrets out.

### Updates and your data

- In-app updates: OpenAlgo checks for a newer version at start and from
  Check for Updates in the profile menu, shows the release notes, and
  downloads nothing until you choose Update. The update's signature is
  checked before it is installed, and a restart that would interrupt Live
  strategies, OpenScript runs, scalping protection or open orders is
  confirmed first. macOS, Windows and AppImage copies update themselves; a
  `.deb` install is pointed to the release page.
- Your data is backed up before a new version changes it, put back if the
  new version cannot open it, and the copy is deleted as soon as the new
  version has opened your data. An older version refuses data that a newer
  one has used, and changes nothing.
- Every release is built from a commit whose full test run passed on every
  platform, including the installed app on each system and a sandbox order
  placed through the app's own window on Linux and Windows.

### Documentation

- A documentation set organised like OpenAlgo web's, in `docs/`: the user
  guide (installation to the charting terminal), the full `/api/v1` and
  WebSocket reference, the MCP tool reference, and guides for contributors.
  Start at `docs/INDEX.md`.

### Known limitations

- The installers are not yet code-signed. Windows SmartScreen and macOS
  Gatekeeper ask you to confirm the first open; the README shows how.
- Not included: the Python Strategy Host, Flow, the Agent (including the
  Assistant panel in `/trading`), and the pandas backtesters (Portfolio
  Backtester, SIP Backtester, Portfolio Analyzer). Use OpenAlgo web for them.
- Fixes coming in the next update:
  - On Delta Exchange, a smart order with a fractional target position and a
    GTT with a fractional quantity are rounded down instead of refused. Use
    whole quantities until the update.
  - An options split order keeps sending the remaining chunks after one whose
    outcome is unknown; check the order book before resending.
  - With a very long order and log history, some log and book pages can slow
    the app's handling of market ticks while they load.
  - The Health page does not yet show market-data skips, database growth or
    records not saved; Run diagnostics does.
