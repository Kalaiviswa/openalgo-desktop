//! Scalping page orders the destination did not confirm (LOG-08).
//!
//! An entry or a risk-reducing exit sent from the scalping page whose
//! answer is neither an acceptance nor a refusal may be at the broker. The
//! page used to get the raw error back, and a click to retry sent it again.
//! Now it is recorded here as unconfirmed, the trader is told to check the
//! order book, and every further order for that contract from the page is
//! refused until the order book settles it:
//!
//! * **found** in the book ([`BookSnapshot::find`]: by the client tag it was
//!   sent with where the broker reports tags, else by its fields and shape
//!   among orders nobody owns), it is settled as placed (an entry joins the
//!   scalping list);
//! * **absent**, [`AbsenceTracker::judge`] decides: in Sandbox a confirmed
//!   absence means it was not placed; in Live absence alone never releases
//!   it (a broker's book can lag; a wrong release lets a second order out).
//!   It is held, the trader is alerted once on the Health page, and it is
//!   released when the trader marks it not placed there. The page does not
//!   read the position before each order, so it gives no `net_before` and a
//!   Live order is never released without the trader.
//!
//! The rows live in `scalping_unconfirmed`, so all of this holds across a
//! restart.
